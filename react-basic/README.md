# Basic React App

This is my first basic react app. And i am using these steps to create it :

1. `npm create vite@latest` to use vite framework for base app.
2. `npm install` to download all required modules
3. `npm run dev` to run the project

Giving Outline of the components
1. **App** : Wrapper all => Parent
2. **Heading**, **Author**, **Contents** => Child of Parent
3. *Bulletin* => Child of Contents  
4. *Props* : Immutable Property given by Parents to child
5. *State* : Intrinsic Characteristic of component itself
